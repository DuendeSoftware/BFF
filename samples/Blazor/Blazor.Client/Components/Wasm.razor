@* TODO - This cascading auth state gets the auth state provider running. But
actually, we don't need the auth state provider to be running. I thought it was
weird that it wasn't, so this forces it to do so, but actually we're not doing
anything with the state changes. *@
@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    private Task<AuthenticationState>? authenticationState { get; set; }
}
